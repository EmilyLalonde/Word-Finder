# Word Finder!

Word finder is an application that displays synonyms for words that are entered in by the user. Once you search for a word the list of synonyms will be displayed below the input. If you click on any of the synonyms that have popped up for the word you search for, a new list of synonyms related to that clicked word will generate.

This application was built using Vue.js and tested with Jest.
